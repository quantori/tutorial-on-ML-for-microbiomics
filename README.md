# Best practices for machine learning in microbiomics

This repository contains python implementations (tested on version 3.10.0) supporting the tutorial described in:

_Dudek, N.K., Chakhvadze, M., Kobakhidze, S., Kantidze, O., Gankin, Y. Supervised machine learning in microbiomics: bridging the gap between current and best practices. In prep for submission (2024)._

In this tutorial, we develop machine learning (ML) classifiers that can predict whether an individual has schizophrenia based on the composition of their fecal microbiota.
