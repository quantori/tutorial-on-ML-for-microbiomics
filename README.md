# Best practices for machine learning in microbiomics

This repository contains python implementations (tested on version 3.7.6) supporting the tutorial described in:

_Dudek, N.K., Chakhvadze, M., Kobakhidze, S., Kantidze, O., Gankin, Y. Best practices for supervised machine learning in microbiomics. In prep for submission (2023)._

In this tutorial, we develop a machine learning (ML) classifier that can predict whether an individual has schizophrenia based on the composition of their fecal microbiota.
